If youâ€™re new to UdonToolkit, we recommend you start with the [installation guide](/docs/installation/). It will walk you through the process of setting it up in your project.

If you encounter any issues during the installation process - you can ask for help [in my discord](https://discord.gg/orels1)!

## Quick start

There are a couple of ways to install the shaders depending on the type of your project

### Using the VRChat Creator Companion


Use the button below

{% add-to-vcc /%}

Or add it manually by using the URL below:

```
https://orels1.github.io/UdonToolkit/index.json
```

If you're not familiar with how to add new repositories to the VCC - [check out the VCC docs](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/guides/community-repositories).

Open the Project Management screen for your project and add the "UdonToolkit" package.

That should all the necessary things to your project!

Check out these docs to learn more about the Behaviours and Attributes available! [The guides section](/docs/guides/guides-overview) might be a good place to start.

For more detailed installation instructions check out the [installation](/docs/installation/) page.

### Learning about Attributes and Behaviours

You can find documentation for all the attributes [here](/docs/attributes/attributes-list). And all the Behaviours [here](/docs/behaviours/overview).

### Getting Updates

If you're updating from an old version, most of the time you can just get the latest release the same way you got the original package and that's it

### Getting help

If you're having trouble with the oacjage, you can ask for help in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/orels1).

If you are a tool developer yourself and want to file a code-specific issue with a bit more detail, drop by the github repo and [submit an issue there](https://github.com/orels1/UdonToolkit/issues/new)!
