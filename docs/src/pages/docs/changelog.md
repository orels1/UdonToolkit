2019 Shader Updates

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/orels1/UdonToolkit/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0)

UdonToolkit was already compatible with 2019, but some shaders would throw a warning, so I fixed it in this release

### Upgrade Udon Sharp and VRCSDK to latest 2019 before installing

You can grab [VRCSDK here](https://vrchat.com/home/download) and [UdonSharp here](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp/releases/tag/v0.20.2)

Here's how Toolkit looks in 2019. I am working on further UI updates to make inspectors even better! But for now you can continue using the UI you are used to

## 1.0.0

### Summary

1.0 is here ðŸŽ‰

- All the inspectors got rewritten from scratch to be much much faster and more configurable
- Almost every attribute got improved, [check out the docs](https://ut.orels.sh/v/v1.x/attributes/attributes-list)
- `ListView` now supports any number of fields
- `Popup` now supports all the animation param types and can also cast things to `int` and `int[]`
- `TabGroup` attribute for even more complicated UIs :P
- `FoldoutGroup` attribute for even more nesting!
- Update loops are gone for delayed Universal Actions (less perf overhead)
- Many bugfixes related to player colliders/chairs etc etc
- Multiple new behaviours, including: Player Modifiers, Teleporter, Velocity Follower, On Respawn and others
- Synced Trigger behaviour using Manual Sync
- Access controls on all the triggers
- Presentation system for creating cool slide decks, same way the [Prefabs TLX](https://tlx.dev) does it

...and much much more

This has been **a long time coming**, it was tested by many people during the past couple of months and it seems to be stable enough to be released.
