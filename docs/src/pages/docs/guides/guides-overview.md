# Guides Overview

Udon Toolkit might be a bit weird to use at first, so here are some examples of real-world things you might want to build with it.

The basic principle of most things in the Toolkit is that there are `Triggers` and `Actions`.  
`Triggers` react to player's input and call `Actions` to do things in the world, if you think about Toolkit in those terms - you should be up and running in notime!
